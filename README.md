This website's design is both simple and accessible. Dynamic particles create an experience that is interactive and visually inviting. The site offers two themes via a toggle, dark mode (default) and light mode. Once toggled, the selected theme should persist between tabs, windows, and page reloads.

Mobile support for the site ranges from 4 in. displays through 6.7 in. all the way up to 13 in. tablets.

I made this website open source under the assumption that others would use the code to create their own websites. I only ask that this code be used with attribution as a significant amount of time was spent writing and optimizing it. Please give proper credit by linking back to [adamalston.com](https://www.adamalston.com/). Thanks!
